# VSS-Encryption
A python implementation of the image secret sharing encryption method described in the Naor-Shamir Visual Cryptography paper, found here: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBFb0053419.pdf

NON-OPERATIONAL CODE for a K out of K shares visual secret sharing scheme.

UPDATING FOR PYTHON 3.7 IN PROGRESS. I don't know who decided it was a good idea to use Python 2.

K out of N currently infeasible. May be a future project.
